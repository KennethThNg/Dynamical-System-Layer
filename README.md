# Dynamical-System-Layer
This is the extension of the dynamical system layer from the semester project of fall 2019 at EFPL

The files code contains the following:
* ``DynamicalSystemLayer``: which consists of the implemented dynamical system as a inner layer and models build with these layer. It contains also test folder with test files to verify if the inner layers perform the correct layer.
* ``models.py``: contains model build with the method from the folder ``DynamicalSystemLayer`` for the usecases.
* ``utils.py``: contains useful methods for the usecases.
* ``pendulum.ipynb``: usecase 1 with the linear dynamical system layer.
* ``lorenz_attractor.ipynib``: usecase 2 with the quadratic dynamical system layer.
* ``NoiseAnalysis.ipynb``: analysis of the dynamical system layer with noisy data.
* ``stock_market.ipynb``: usecase 3 with a neural net model including the dynamical system as inner layer on stock market data.
* ``z_lorenz.ipynb``: usecase 4 with a neural net model including the dynamical system as inner layer on the third component of the Lorenz attractor.
